<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Inheritance" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/5/inheritance/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I implemented a program that simulates the inheritance of blood types through multiple generations. Using a data structure for family members, the program recursively generates family trees with randomly assigned blood type alleles to simulate inheritance patterns over generations.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Family Structure</strong>: Each person in the family tree is represented as a struct containing pointers to their parents and two blood type alleles.</li> <li><strong>Inheritance Simulation</strong>: The program uses recursive functions to create family trees, simulate inheritance, and display the family members' blood types.</li> <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Allocates memory for each family member and their data and correctly frees it after use to prevent memory leaks.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Define Family Tree Structure</strong>: A struct is created for each person, containing alleles and pointers to parent structs.</li> <li><strong>Recursive Generation</strong>: The program creates a family tree of a specified generation depth by recursively allocating memory for each person and assigning blood type alleles.</li> <li><strong>Random Allele Assignment</strong>: Alleles are randomly assigned to each person based on their parents’ alleles to simulate inheritance.</li> <li><strong>Print Family Tree</strong>: The program prints each generation’s blood types, illustrating inheritance patterns.</li> <li><strong>Memory Cleanup</strong>: Each family member’s memory is freed in a post-order traversal to ensure no memory leaks occur.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as Makefiles or sample inputs.</p>
